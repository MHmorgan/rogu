TODO
----

* Implement `release` command:
  Create a new release+tag on GitHub, and upload release
  assets automatically. Use GitHub CLI as library?

* Use [github.com/cli/go-gh](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cli/go-gh)
  for interract with github releases and assets.  
  See [endpoints](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps).

* Use a single item for all templates.
